## Xontrib Promotion (DO and REMOVE THIS SECTION)

* Check that your repository name starts from `xontrib-` prefix. It helps Github search find it.

* Add `xonsh`, `xontrib` and other thematic topics to the repository "About" setting.

* Add preview image in "Settings" - "Options" - "Social preview". It allows to show preview image in Github Topics and social networks e.g. Twitter.

* Enable "Sponsorship" in "Settings" - "Features" - Check "Sponsorships".

* Add xontrib to the [awesome-xontribs](https://github.com/xonsh/awesome-xontribs).

* Publish your xontrib to PyPi via Github Actions and users can install your xontrib via `xpip install xontrib-myxontrib`. Easiest way to achieve it is to use Github Actions. Register to https://pypi.org/ and [create API token](https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken). Go to repository "Settings" - "Secrets" and your PyPI API token as `PYPI_API_TOKEN` as a "Repository Secret". Now when you create new Release the Github Actions will publish the xontrib to PyPi automatically. Release status will be in Actions sction. See also `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
